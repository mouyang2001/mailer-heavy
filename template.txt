We hope this message finds you well.

Due to the culmination of the semester, and acknowledging the busy schedules of our mentors and mentees, we have decided to reschedule the DEVS Mentoring Launch Night. We regret to inform you that the original event planned for this evening has been canceled.

Our primary goal is to create an event that allows maximum participation, interaction, and value for all attendees. We understand that this decision may have caused some inconvenience and we deeply apologize for any disruption to your plans.

We are excited about the opportunity to host this event at a more suitable time during the next semester, where we anticipate more availability from our valued mentors and mentees.

Updates regarding the new date and further details will be communicated to you at the earliest.

Thank you for your understanding and patience. We are looking forward to welcoming you to the rescheduled DEVS Mentoring Launch Night.

NgƒÅ mihi
